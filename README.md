# Life-Insurance-Risk-Prediction
To Predict whether an application will be high risk or low risk based on attributes.

# Project Description

The dataset which is used in this work is taken from PrudentialLife Insurance Assessment and this is available 
on kaggle.

In this dataset, over hundreds of variables are used describing characteristics of life insurance
applicants. 

The task was to predict the "Response" variable.To Predict whether an application will be high risk or low risk based on attributes.

It containstotal 59382 rows and 128 columns. The 128 columns contain:
Id field, 26 features characteristic of policyholder and a response variable of 8 levels of ordered risk. 
There are total 60 categorical features and 13 continuous variables, 5 discrete
variables and 48 dummy variables in this dataset.

Performed data preprocessing and gain insights from data using matplotlib and seabron.

Applied Dimension reduction technique PCA to speed up machine learning algorithm.
